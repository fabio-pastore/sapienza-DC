A domain-aware retrieval-augmented generation chatbot powered by LLM (both local and through OpenAI-compatible API). Sapienza-DC answers user queries by searching across curated domains, extracting relevant content through web parsing, and generating responses with explicit reliability scoring and source attribution.

## Objectives

Sapienza-DC was built to explore the feasibility of a fully local, domain-constrained RAG system. The project targets environments with limited computational resources (consumer CPUs, 16 GB RAM, optional GPU) while maintaining a production-quality user experience. It serves as a testbed for:

- **Structured prompt engineering** for query validation, routing, and grounded generation
- **Efficient embedding** and reranking strategies for small models
- Integration of external web parsing tools (_MWP_) into a **coherent RAG pipeline**
- **Transparent** AI through explicit *reliability scoring and source attribution*

## Running the project

### Prerequisites

#### System Requirements
- Docker with BuildKit enabled
  - Enable BuildKit by setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` or using `docker buildx`
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB+ recommended for Windows 11 or complex models)
- Storage: At least 20 GB free disk space (for models + dependencies)
- CPU: Recommend Ryzen 5 4600H or better. Total generation time from tests with the 4600H is ~2min 30s.
- Optional:
  - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (for accelerated inference)
  - GPU drivers installed (if using CUDA)

#### Environment Setup
1. `.env` File (in project root)
   - Required variables:
     ```env
     MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=
     MARIADB_USER=
     MARIADB_PASSWORD=
     MARIADB_DATABASE=
     ```
   - Optional variables:
     ```env
     MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH=   # Default: 6000
     TOP_K_CHUNKS=        # Default: 10
     LLM_N_CTX=           # Default: 4608
     LLM_N_BATCH=         # Default: 512
     LLM_MODEL_PATH=      # Default: /models/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512-Q4_K_M.gguf
     LLM_PROVIDER=        # Default: local
     OPENAI_API_KEY=
     OPENAI_BASE_URL=
     OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=
     HF_TOKEN=
     ```
   - Notes:
     - Adjust values based on your hardware (e.g., reduce `LLM_N_CTX` or `LLM_N_BATCH` if OOM errors occur).
     - Ensure `LLM_MODEL_PATH` points to a valid `.gguf` file (or your preferred, llama.cpp supported model format).
     - `HF_TOKEN` is not necessary but can help avoid rate limits and increase download speeds during initialization of HF (_Hugging Face_) models.

2. - Model File
     - Place your model in `/models/` (and update `LLM_MODEL_PATH` in `.env`).

     OR

   - Bring Your Own Key
     - Set LLM_PROVIDER=api
     - Optional: Set OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_BASE_URL and OPENAI_MODEL_NAME (they can be submitted through the Web UI)

   - Notes:
     - Our Web UI allows for the switch between the two modes during runtime.
     - The local LLM will persist in memory once loaded (there's no unload after a switch to API).
   
### CPU-only deployment
- bash:
  ```bash
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose up --build
  ```
- Windows PowerShell:
  ```bash
  $env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1; docker compose up --build
  ```
- Windows CMD:
  ```bash
  set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1&& docker compose up --build
  ```
### GPU-accelerated deployment
- bash:
  ```bash
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml up --build
  ```
- Windows PowerShell:
  ```bash
  $env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1; docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml up --build
  ```
- Windows CMD:
  ```bash
  set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1&& docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml up --build
  ```
  
#### Troubleshooting
- Out of Memory (OOM):
  - Reduce `LLM_N_BATCH` (slower) or `LLM_N_CTX`, `MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, `TOP_K_CHUNKS` (may worsen or even break the pipeline).
  - Use a smaller model (e.g., `TinyLlama` instead of `Ministral-3B`).
- CUDA Errors:
  - Verify `nvidia-smi` detects your GPU.
  - Ensure Docker has GPU access (`docker run --gpus all ...`).

## Access

- Frontend: http://localhost:8002
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001
- API documentation: http://localhost:8001/docs

## Supported domains

The system currently supports content extraction from four domains through the MWP microservice:

- <a href="it.wikipedia.org">it.wikipedia.org</a> -- general Italian knowledge
- www.ipsos.com -- market research and public opinion data
- www.raiplaysound.it -- Italian radio and podcast content
- www.marvel.com -- Marvel comics and MCU information

When a query cannot be assigned to a domain, a generic, domain-indefinite parse is requested to the MWP client as a means of fallback. This allows the LLM to answer extremely specific or niche questions for which no answer can be found on the provided domains.

## Key features

**Intelligent guardrail system**:
every user query passes through a validation layer that classifies it as allowed, ambiguous, or rejected. Ambiguous queries prompt the user for clarification before proceeding to search. The guardrail also determines which domain best matches the query intent, enabling automatic routing to the appropriate knowledge source.

**Prompt injection mitigation**:
both user input and externally retrieved content are sanitized before reaching the LLM. Input queries are validated against suspicious patterns commonly used in prompt injection attacks, including instruction override attempts, emotional manipulation and system-level command delimiters. Text chunks extracted from web pages are filtered for embedded instructions before inclusion in the LLM context. Strong XML-style delimiters in all internal prompts enforce a strict separation between system instructions and user-provided or externally-retrieved data, reducing the attack surface for indirect prompt injection through compromised web content.

**Multi-domain search with fallback**:
the system searches across a primary target domain and supplements results from Wikipedia when needed. If Startpage-based scraping returns no results, the Wikipedia OpenSearch API acts as a fallback retriever.

**Two-stage chunk selection**:
retrieved documents are chunked with overlap, embedded using a multilingual E5-small model (384 dimensions), and filtered by cosine similarity. The top candidates are then reranked by a cross-encoder (MS Marco MiniLM) for precise relevance scoring. This balances speed and accuracy within tight resource constraints.

**Transparent reliability scoring**:
every generated answer includes a mandatory reliability section (affidabilità). The LLM self-assesses how well the reference texts support its response, providing both a qualitative comment and an integer score from 1 to 5. The score can be used by users to gauge confidence in the generated content.

**Response streaming with progress feedback**:
server-sent events stream both status updates and answer tokens to the frontend. Users see real-time feedback during searching, data extraction, chunk selection, and answer generation phases, making latency from the local LLM more tolerable and the system behavior more transparent.

**Parse caching**:
parsed page content is stored in MariaDB keyed by URL. Subsequent queries referencing the same URLs skip the web parsing step entirely, reducing both latency and load on the MWP microservice.

**Conversation continuity**:
chat history is persisted across sessions. The system uses historical context to rewrite follow-up queries, resolve pronouns and implicit references, and maintain domain routing consistency within a conversation.

### Core components

- Two-stage retrieval: bi-encoder cosine similarity followed by cross-encoder reranking
- Local LLM/API inference with streaming token generation via SSE
- Persistent chat history and URL parse caching through MariaDB

**Frontend** (FastAPI + Jinja2 on port 8002)
- Clean, responsive chat interface styled with Tailwind CSS
- Session management with conversation history browsing
- Real-time streaming of LLM responses with status indicators

## Architecture overview

The project follows a microservice-oriented architecture orchestrated through Docker compose, with a clear separation between the backend RAG pipeline and the frontend chat interface.

_**NOTE**_: the pipeline was tested with ```Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512-Q4_K_M```, though using this specific model is not a requirement.

## Limitations and future work

~~The system is constrained if used with a 3B parameter model's reasoning capabilities, particularly for complex multi-hop questions.~~ Domain support is currently limited to the four configured websites. Fallback parsing may extract relevant information but may also introduce excessive noise, since the employed parser is generic. ~~Memory usage under Docker on Windows11 with 16 GB RAM (CPU-only setup) remains tight, and future iterations may migrate to llama.cpp for more efficient CPU inference and reduced container overhead.~~
